# Deep Javascript Foundations, v3

[slides](https://static.frontendmasters.com/resources/2019-03-07-deep-javascript-v2/deep-js-foundations-v2.pdf)

# primitive type

- undefined
- string
- number
- boolean
- object
- symbol
- null
- bigInt

- `subtype` of object
- `function` or callable objects
- `array`

# dynamic type language

variables do not have types, values do

# emptiness

1. `undefined`
   There is a variable although at the moment it has no value.
2. `undeclared`
   It is never been created;
3. `uninitialized`
   consecuencua: you are not allow to touch it.

# special values

1. `NaN`: invalid number
   Defining:

```
Number('mai') //NaN
```

Operating with invalid numbers

```
'aa'-'bb' //NaN
```

It is the only value that It has no identity property. NaN is not equal to a NaN

```
NaN === NaN  //false
```

# negative zero

# coersion

Type convertion

Implicit coersion and explicit coersion.

When should we use explicit coersion? For example, when we wanna make sure that both of them are numbers so you don't get something weird:

```
if (Number(mayBeANumber1) < Number(mayBeANumber1)) {}
```

# equality

The decision about double equals and triple equals is an indicator of wheter you actually understand your program.
Decide what your types are, and make it obvius!

## possible quesitons:

- if I know the types, is coercion helpful or not?
- Is it more safe or is it less safe?
- Do you know the types on the comparison?
- Are too impredictable?
- Is coercion helpuful in a equality comparison?
- are you gaining readability?

## indicators:

- rule: knowing the types is always better than not knowing them
-

> `null` and `undefined`

- they are coercive to each other.
- they are indistibguishable through coercive equality

## doble equals

- if types are the same, then compare with triple equals `===`
- always compare primitives
- cuando tenÃ©s algo que NO es una primitiva, la convierte a primitiva.

> `==` summary

```
if the type are the same: ===
if `null` or `undefined` : true
if non-primitive: ToPrimitive
Prefer: Number
```

> when to use it

1. WHEN YOU KNOW THE TYPES!
   `==` is not about comparison with unknown types. Do not use `==` in that scenario! You should strive to know the types in your comparisons as much as possible.

# types

## Rules

> Knowing the types is always better than not knowing them

> Static types is not the only way to know your types

> if you know the types in a comparison, wheter the types match or not, `==` is the more sensible choice

> if you know the types in a comparison

- and the types are different: one `===` would be broken!

- and the types are equal: prefer the more powerfull `==`, or don't compare at all

> if you dont' know the types in a comparison, means not fully understanding your code

Not knowing the types, should be a rarety rather than the status quo. That part of the code is hard to understand because of that uncertainty.
The uncertainty of not knowing types should be obvious to the reader. The most obvious signal about uncertainty is `===`

> the `==` is preferable when you know the types

> the `===` should be reserved for the cases where you don't know the types

"I don't know the types, I am trying to protect myself".
"There is a triple equals, there are some uncertainty of the types " -> We need to restrict ourselves so we don't run into a corner case.

> Assume the worse case coercion when you don't know the types

> Not knowing the types is equivalent to assuming type conversion

The only safe response to that is protect yourself from that with `===`
